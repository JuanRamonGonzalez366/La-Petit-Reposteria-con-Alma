  "about": {
    "title": "It all began with a dream and a flavor that transcends.",
    "subtitle1": "The story of this pastry shop began long before it was called Petit. It all started when I was just 7 or 8 years old and my mother sent me every afternoon to buy bread. I loved standing there, watching the bakers at work—that aroma, that atmosphere… to me, it was magic. When I returned home, I would play at imitating what I had seen and create my own little pastries. That game, which began out of curiosity, gradually turned into a true passion: that is how my love for pastry was born.",
    "subtitle2": "Over the years, this passion took on a new meaning. When my first child turned one, I wanted to celebrate with a special cake. Since I didn’t know how to make the decorations I imagined, I ended up buying one from a well-known bakery. It looked beautiful, but my family didn’t like the flavor. We cut the cake, but no one ate it. Days later, I threw it away, and at that moment I made myself a promise: the next birthday would be different; I would make a delicious and special cake for my son myself. And I kept that promise. I studied, practiced, and that day I prepared my very first cake truly made with love.",
    "subtitle3": "That spark began to grow. Family and friends started asking me to make cakes for their events, all baked and decorated in my home kitchen.",
    "subtitle4": "On December 19, 1999, in the middle of a family financial crisis, I made two decisions: to support our household economy and to share joy through my desserts. That is how I opened my first pastry shop in downtown Tlaquepaque. It was a tiny place that I ran myself, and that’s where its name came from: Petit. That same day, Pier—our little chef—was also born, and he has been with us through every stage of this story.",
    "subtitle5": "Over time, thanks to the trust of our customers and the effort of many people who have joined this project, Petit has grown. Today we remain the same family and the same essence, but with new generations, new projects, and a modern production facility. Our image has been renewed, but our heart has not changed.",
    "subtitle6": "We continue preparing the same recipes, with the same quality, the same flavor, and above all, the same soul.",
    "subtitle7": "We are Petit… Pastry with Soul.",
