  "title": "History",

  "textbold1": "The Beginnings",
  "subtitle1": "From a young age, Alma helped her parents in a small grocery store, where she also prepared cakes to sell to customers. She used a small toaster oven and basic kitchen utensils, which allowed her to gain experience in pastry-making from an early age.",
  "subtitle2": "Over time, she started a family with Rubén and their two children. With her demanding taste for cooking, she was never satisfied with the cakes and desserts available in the local market. One day, she decided to bake her eldest son’s birthday cake for his second birthday herself. From that moment on, friends and acquaintances began asking her to make cakes for their celebrations.",
  "subtitle3": "To improve her skills and offer more options, she took several basic pastry courses. All the cakes were prepared in a small space at the back of her kitchen, working by order and through word-of-mouth recommendations.",

  "textbold2": "The Entrepreneurial Journey",
  "subtitle4": "In 1999, Alma decided to take the next step and open her own pastry shop. Although her family had some doubts about the business’s success, her father supported her by offering a small old adobe property next to his house. The space was adapted and a 35 m² shop was built, financed through savings and strict control of weekly expenses.",
  "subtitle5": "The big day arrived in December 1999, when Pastelería Petit opened its doors in the heart of Tlaquepaque. Alma had prepared ten cakes of different flavors over two days. To her surprise, all of them were sold within just two days, allowing them to purchase the raw materials and utensils needed to continue the venture.",
  "subtitle6": "We continue preparing the same recipes, with the same quality, the same flavor, and above all, the same soul.",

  "textbold3": "Growth and Success",
  "subtitle7": "During the following nights, she worked alone, baking cakes to sell during the day. Three years later, the first branch was inaugurated in a location that Rubén instinctively chose along the route to their children’s school, in an area surrounded by many schools. Rubén’s intuition proved right, and the new branch was a great success.",
  "subtitle8": "Over time, the brand began to consolidate. To stand out in the market, they registered the name Pastelerías Petit GDL and improved their image and logo. In 2005, the third branch was inaugurated.",

  "textbold4": "Innovation and Renewal",
  "subtitle9": "As the years went by and thanks to word of mouth, the number of branches increased. The product range also grew, adapting to new trends. In 2025, the family decided to refresh the brand, and in November 2025, they introduced the new PETIT image.",

  "textbold5": "Pastry with Soul",
  "subtitle10": "This evolution not only renewed the brand’s presentation but also strengthened the experience at every point of sale, reflecting what has always set Petit apart: pastry made with dedication, tradition, and heart. Every space was designed to convey warmth, closeness, and the love put into every creation.",

  "textbold6": "Commitment to the Community",
  "subtitle11": "Petit is not only dedicated to creating high-quality products; it also believes in transcending through people. As a pastry company with soul, it maintains a strong commitment to the local community, promoting well-being and social development, especially for children, whom the Petit family recognizes as the foundation of change and the future of our society.",

  "textbold7": "Looking to the Future",
  "subtitle12": "Today, Petit is a Mexican, family-owned company that honors its history while looking ahead. With plans for expansion and the creation of new products, the family continues working to bring sweet and memorable moments to every home, always preserving the essence that defines them: pastry with soul, made to accompany life, celebrations, and memories.",

  "textbold8": "Why Petit?",
  "subtitle13": "   *The finest pastery is France",
  "subtitle14": "   *Petit is Small",
  "subtitle15": "   *Pastery Chiquita",

  "textbold9": "WHY PIERRE? ",
  "subtitle16": "Pierre is a French-Mexican pastry chef who merges the European pastry tradition with his unique style to create delicious cakes and posters.",
