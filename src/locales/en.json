  "about": {
    "title": "Pasteleria Petit Present, The Story of the Petit Family, told by Doña Alma founder of this great fraternity",
    "subtitle": "The history of this bakery began long before the name Petit. It all really started when I was 7 or 8 years old and my mother sent me every afternoon to buy bread, and I watched the bakers prepare bread with a special aroma. To me, it was like magic, it was a spectacle. When I got home, I would play with the same ingredients the bakers used and make little cakes. This game continued for many years in my life, and I started to create my own recipes and processes, until, without realizing it, I developed a love for BAKING. This game became something more serious and important when my first child was born and turned one year old. I needed a cake to celebrate. I couldn't make one because I didn't know how to do the decorations. So I bought one from a prestigious bakery, which was good, but unfortunately my family didn't like it. We cut the cake to celebrate, but no one ate it. A few days later, I had to throw it away, and at that moment, I promised myself that the following year I would make a special cake for my son. And so I did. I studied, prepared myself, and made a delicious and beautiful cake for my son. From that day on, some friends and family members began to ask me for cakes for their events, which I baked and decorated in my kitchen at home. On December 19, 1999, in the midst of a family economic crisis, I had two goals: first, to help the family finances, and second, to bring joy through my baking. I made an important decision to open a bakery in downtown Tlaquepaque, and that day Petit was born. It was a very small bakery that I ran myself, baking the cakes. That's where the name Petit comes from, meaning small. Along with it, the little chef Pier was born, who accompanies us in our image. Over the years, with the acceptance of our customers and many people who collaborate to make this joy possible, Petit has grown and our image has evolved alongside it. Currently, new generations are arriving at Petit, both in terms of projects, such as the construction of a large, modern production plant, and the renewal of our image. We are the same story, the same family, preparing the same recipes with the same quality and flavor. We are Petit… Pastry House with Soul.",
