  "about": {
    "title": "What is now Petit was once a dream filled with faith. Mrs. Alma tells you how Petit went from being a family dream to becoming a home for those who love baking with soul.",
    "subtitle1": "The history of this bakery began long before it was called Petit. It all started when I was just 7 or 8 years old and my mom sent me to buy bread every afternoon. I loved watching the bakers work: that aroma, that atmosphere... for me, it was magic. When I got home, I would play at imitating what I saw and create my own little cakes. That game, which began out of curiosity, gradually became a real passion: that's how my love of baking was born.",
    "subtitle2": "Over the years, this hobby took on a new meaning. When my first child turned one, I wanted to celebrate with a special cake. Since I didn't know how to make the decorations I had in mind, I ended up buying it from a well-known bakery. It was pretty, but my family didn't like the taste. We cut the cake, but no one ate it. A few days later, I threw it away, and at that moment, I made a promise to myself: the next birthday would be different; I would make a delicious and special cake for my son myself. And I kept my promise. I studied, practiced, and on that day I made my first cake truly made with love.",
    "subtitle3": "That spark began to grow. Family and friends started asking me for cakes for their events, all baked and decorated from my kitchen at home.",
    "subtitle4": "On December 19, 1999, in the midst of a family economic crisis, I made two decisions: to support the household economy and to share joy through my desserts. That's how I opened my first bakery in downtown Tlaquepaque. It was a tiny place that I ran myself, and that's where its name came from: Petit. That day also saw the birth of Pier, our little chef, who has been with us every step of the way.",
    "subtitle5": "Over time, thanks to the trust of our customers and the efforts of many people who have joined the project, Petit has grown. Today we are still the same family and the same essence, but with new generations, new projects, and a modern production facility. Our image has been revamped, but our heart has not changed.",
    "subtitle6": "We continue to prepare the same recipes, with the same quality, the same flavor, and above all, the same soul.",
    "subtitle7": "We are Petit... Pastries with Soul.",
